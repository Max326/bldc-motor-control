# bldc-motor-control

This is a 3-phase BLDC motor control project. It runs on a STM32F411E-Disco board, and an X-NUCLEO-IHM07M1 extension board.

Normally, the extension board would be used with a Nucleo board, but the one that was in the kit had been broken.

It requires 11V and 1A to power. 

The documentation for this project is in the "BLDC_Control_Documentation" file.
